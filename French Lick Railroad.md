(we really need to create our own joomla framework with Foundation)

dave giving background

introducing me

## letâ€™s talk
Hi level

Rick
## currently hosting on homestead. 
>found it to be limiting
a bit of a pain
had some limitations
some will go away with some image mapping and static images that it doesn't support... not a problem anymore

### integration with our ticketing software
>some code to insert to embed calendars and ticket purchases, etc.
can't find some code yet.

### big thing - site redesign
> has a dated feel, now five years old
get updated

* more welcoming home page
* scrolling images or something there at the beginning
* maybe four options, book tickets, special events, something like that
* easily modified
  * so i can do these plugins
  * would like to farm that out to others at work.
* obviously mobile portion

Dave
> I can tell you that any time we approach a web design, we follow mobile-first methodology.
first design for mobile.
can't find it, get a good mobile... aren't gonna look at a desktop.

rick
> just sent you a sample of the coding. has iframe in java

dave
> perfect

rick
> i have the sample code for all of this
the code they supplied is not a static size
500 events to list, the web page would go 500 down instead of sticking a scroll bar in.
had to mod the code to set the frame to a certain size
other problem (the reason we don't have it on the home page)
if you view this on the mobile, the frame takes over and you don't see any of the other content.
all you can see is buy tickets.
that may be the way i have it or an issue to their code.

dave
> i would say off hand, probably the way they've defined the iframe
not uncommon
iframes are notoriously fickle in integration
may also depend on browser used.

### question on the hosting
are you fixed with homestead?
rick
> if staying there means I have to use their platform, take it as far away from there as you can.
no allegiance, not happy with product.

dave
> i'm sorry to hear that, but we do hosting, too!
you won't have limitations! (within reason)

rick
> it's not the limitations so much as the design on the backend for the site is clunky and really hard to use.
their backend was not easy to use

dave
> if you're comfortable with dreamweaver, we can do that....
not great for the long term

rick
> something like wp that's easy to use but not too limiting.

dave
> what kind of traffic load do you have or anticipate on the site?
per month?
what kind of framework makes sense... wp can lose performance under high traffic loads. 10-15K/month

rick
> that's information I can't really give ya.
we tried setting up Google analytics with the site, never worked
> I know that in the November time frame... i would not be surprised if we were doing 20-30K for Nov/Dec
Jan/Feb may get as few as 2-3K

dave
> we'll wire statistics into everything

rick
> majority of our marketing is on Facebook
talked with Carrie about this a little bit
not currently using the pixel
Carrie said that unless you're purchasing directly into the site, may not give great data on conversion from fb

dave
> depending on how we can integrate with whistle tix, we can see about better tracking
I would be really surprised if they don't have the ability to track patterns like that

rick
> i can't tell that the person who saw the fb ad go to our site and purchase the ticket.

dave
> probably not the first time they've had this question

rick
> we'll have you talk to the wTix team 

## November?
rick
> we launch our sales for Polar Express (our bread and butter) on November 3
tickets for 2018 will go on sale, too
before the end of November, will probably have sold 15K tickets
ideally, would love to launch around the middle of the night on Nov 2nd/3rd
tight time-frame...
if not doable, I'd rather push it to January time-frame.

dave
> depending on how much redesign, we have two months, that should be good.

### Budget?
rick
> i don't know
spent 4K on our site last time.
not sure of the going rate

dave
> kind of an open q, right? like "how much for a car?"

### Joel Review
dave
> I'll have Joel go through the site, soup to nuts
based on that, what will it take to modernize, mobile friendly, clear ctas.
then we can quote a price on that.

>in that time frame, we'll pull in some data form the ticketing system to anticipate cost on that as well

rick
> let me take a look through and get you some sites that I like and get you an idea of what design I'm looking for.

## Agile Push
dave
> we are very interactive with our clients
scrum/agile explanation
relying on rick to tell us what he needs.
advantage is that we don't focus on things that you don't want or care about.
focus on what you want and focus heavily. eliminate waste.

rick
> sounds good. rather do that than at the end of the day be surprised

dave
> at the end of the day i want to make sure that this product is much closer to your vision, not mine.

## To Do:
* Rick is going to look at some sites to let us know his design bent.
* Joel will evaluate current site.
* Dave will look into WhistleTix.

Then we can see if we're able to do the November date.
not hearing anything that would be a huge roadblock.

## Follow Up
Meeting Tuesday
