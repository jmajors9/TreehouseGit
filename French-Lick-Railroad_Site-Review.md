# French Lick RR Site Review

[French Lick Scenic Railway](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org)

## General
* Needs to be Responsive (Mobile-first)
* So many images are stretched and pixelated, especially in the menu.
* Logo needs to lose the gradient. hard to read.
* Pages are not balanced and need negative space to draw attention.

## Pages

### Home
[Home](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/index.html)
* Super boring, way too much reading (Don't Make Me Think)
* As Rick said, "Needs to be more welcoming"


#### No call to Action
* No one is asked to Purchase Tickets. Needs to be in metaphorical flashing neon


### Take a Ride
[Take a Ride](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/Take-A-Ride.html)
Page is all jacked up

* most of the information above the fold is duplicated on the home screen.
This should maybe be the home page.
* Fares and hours and stuff looks ok, but will look awful on mobile.


### Information Station
[Information Station](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/Information-Station.html)
* History is cool.
* More photos and photos with people would be cool.
* Text should be much larger
* "Current Collection" doesn't translate for non-train people. "Our Stable", or "Our Engines"...


### Special Events
[Special Events](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/Special-Events.html)

Almost all of these need to just stay on the same page.

#### The Polar Express

##### Above the fold
* Same image problems: over-stretched and pixelated
* Text small and difficult to read.
* Clear announcement of dates
* Prices are rather hard to find.
* WhistleTix doesn't play well

##### FAQ
* hidden at the bottom of the screen for some reason.
* need to find a better way to present the faq.


#### Day Out with Thomas 
Just a static image with divs hiding on top.
Completely different look than all the rest of the site. That's a no-no.

##### Photo
* has no link

##### Buy Tickets 
* Takes you to a completely different site. 
* Does it need to do that? We should find some way to embed

##### FAQ
* Could only click on just the letter Q. Very Bad UX.
* Most of these questions could be answered as part of a properly designed page.
* Many of these questions can be addressed in a generic FAQ.

###### Editing
* Who is Thomas? should have "chugged" instead of "chugges"
* When should we arrive? "one houir" should be "hour"
* Is there parking available? "adjecent" should be "adjacent"
* Other rewording may be applied for clarity.


#### Wild West Hold-ups
* The skeumorphism is fun, but the CTA is lost.
* Balance is off
* Schedule draws attention well, but too small
* Pricing needs to draw more attention.
* WhistleTix refuses to fit within the normal "div bounds".


#### Train to Strassenfest
* Good bulletin, decent site
* Yellow lettering is not helpful
* WhistleTix refuses to fit within the normal "div bounds".


#### Chocolate Tasting Train
* All images are stretched and pixelated.
* Text is hard to read
* I didn't know there was liquor involved until I got to the page and saw the big 
* Should have "Tasting Train" emphasized over Chocolate.


### Members & Volunteers
[Members & Volunteers](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/Members-Volunteers.html)
#### CTA burried at bottom of page
Needs to be closer to member stuff, above volunteer info

* Consider a different name than "member". Partner? Conductees? Unrelated to the page, but potentially helpful for marketing.
* need some callouts for the member stuff.
* page is not balanced (see top)


### Charters
[Charters](http://www.frenchlickscenicrailway.org/privatecharters.html)

* Text is small, no real CTAs
* Images ok, but could pose a problem for responsive sizing.
* Haven't figured what yet, but there needs to be something to differentiate these more. Some sort of standard for viewing.

### Film Shoots
Not included in top menu?

If this actually makes you money, it needs to be comewhere _much_ more obvious.

## Footer
### Secondary Menu at the bottom superfluous

* Mojo Media - last update seems to have been 2010
* Homestead - last update seems to have been 2016. yikes.
